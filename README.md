## Project Description
Netflix has consistently seen growth in its subscriptions. This project aims to:
- Analyze subscription trends over different time periods.
- Train and evaluate a Linear Regression model to forecast future subscription numbers.
- Provide data-driven insights to understand subscription growth patterns.

## Dataset
The dataset contains subscription data for Netflix, including:
- Time periods (e.g., quarters or years)
- Total number of subscribers
- Quarterly or annual growth rates

### Data Preprocessing
The dataset was cleaned and processed to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Features were engineered to derive meaningful insights.

## Key Features
- **Subscription Trend Analysis**: Visualization of subscriber growth trends over time.
- **Growth Rate Calculation**: Analysis of quarterly and annual growth rates.
- **Forecasting**: Predicting future subscription numbers using a trained Linear Regression model.
- **Visualization**: Dynamic and static visualizations to communicate insights.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Plotly
- **Machine Learning**: Linear Regression

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/netflix-subscriptions-forecasting.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd netflix-subscriptions-forecasting
   ```

3. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Prepare the dataset and place it in the `data` folder.
2. Run the analysis script:
   ```bash
   python analysis.py
   ```
3. Visualizations and model predictions will be saved in the `output` folder.

## Results
- **Model Performance**:
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE): _Insert Value_
  - RÂ² Score: _Insert Value_
- **Insights**:
  - Average quarterly growth: _Insert Value_
  - Predicted subscribers for the next quarter: _Insert Value_

### Sample Visualization

## Future Improvements
- Use more complex machine learning models for better forecasting accuracy.
- Incorporate external factors (e.g., market trends, competition) into the model.
- Develop a dashboard for real-time forecasting and visualization.
